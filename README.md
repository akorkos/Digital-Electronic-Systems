## Introduction

Digital design of logic circuits is a fundamental part of computer engineering.
The design of logic circuits is done using Hardware Description Languages (HDLs).
The most common HDLs are Verilog and VHDL. This project focuses on the design of
logic circuits using VHDL. The project is divided into two parts. The first part
focuses on the design of combinational circuits, while the second part focuses 
on the design of sequential circuits. All the circuits designed and 
implemented are fundamental circuits, that are used in the design of more 
complex circuits.
